        <p>There is quite alot that makes up steven. some things include i worked on a ranch in my formative years, grew up in the oilpatch, and had more horses than most people would have in a lifetime.</p>
        <p>ive traveled around the world in my teenage years, and seen so much culture and worldviews. it has left me changed foundationally.</p>
        <head>Some of my favourite travel destionations, and what i enjoyed about them.</head>
          <ol>
            <li>Venice</li>
              <p>The city of venice was definiteley a sight to behold, with its long standing history, the city had so many things to see and places to go. our group attended a glass blowing demonstration where he created a horse rather efficently.</p>
            <li>Rome</li>
              <p>Rome wasnt built in a day, And i dont think i could list off all the fun things i did in rome in a day either! The collasseum was absolutley MASSIVE. </p>
            <li>Paris</li>
            <p>The city of lights, or of love. Paris was beautiful, full of natural parks, and ages of history. I got to go to The Louvre and expience hundreds if not thousands of years worth of stolen art.
            
            </p>
            <li>Belize</li>
            <p>To be fair i feel belize was still the kindest place I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. the food from all the places was great biut the food here tasted like it had actual emotion in it. the locals were kind, and would help with anyhting i needed help with din a heartbeat. </p>
          </ol>
        <p>I got the amazing opportunity to travel through various school planned trips, and they are some of the memories i will hold near and dear. </p>
